<h2>Description</h2>
<p>White soup, or Nsala, is a light, spicy dish from Nigeria’s Igbo culture, made 
   without palm oil for a clean, subtle flavor. Thickened with yam and cooked with 
   chicken or fish, it’s seasoned with utazi leaves and pepper, often paired with 
   pounded yam. This simple yet bold soup is perfect for a cozy meal.
