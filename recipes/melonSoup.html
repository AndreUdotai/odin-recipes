    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi soup is a flavorful West African dish, popular in Nigeria and Ghana, 
        made from ground melon seeds that create a thick, nutty base. Cooked with 
        vegetables like spinach, proteins such as goat or fish, and spiced with palm 
        oil and crayfish, it is typically served with pounded yam or rice. This hearty 
        soup is a regional favorite, perfect for any occasion.
